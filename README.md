# GCommit - Group Commit

GCommit is a git-plugin that eases how to commit when you need to sign for
more than one person -- pair and mob programming reality.

Instead of having to set manually the other developers names, you can define
once and reference at any commit-time.

## How to use

GCommit reads a file that defines your teammates signatures, so first create
a `.gitteam` file in your project's root directory, that follows the following
structure:

```plain
JD="João Daniel <jotaf.daniel@gmail.com>"
JOD="John Doe <jon.doe@example.com>"
JAD="Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>"
```

> note: there's no empty line at the end

Once you have `.gitteam` in your repository, you can commit something using:

```bash
git gcommit JAD JD
```

This will generate a initial commit message like this:

```plain


Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>
Signed-off-by: João Daniel <jotaf.daniel@gmail.com>
```
